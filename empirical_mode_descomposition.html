    <p><strong><em>Abstract</em>—Due to external stimuli, biomedical signals are
        in general non-linear and non-stationary. <em>Empirical Mode De
       composition in conjunction</em> with a <em>Hilbert spectral transform</em>,
        together called Hilbert-Huang Transform, is ideally suited to
        extract essential components which are characteristic of the
        underlying biological or physiological processes. The method
        is fully adaptive and generates the basis to represent the
        data solely from these data and based on them. The basis
        functions, called <em>Intrinsic Mode Functions</em>  (IMFs) represent
        a complete set of locally orthogonal basis functions whose
        amplitude and frequency may vary over time. The contribution
        reviews the technique of EMD and related algorithms and
        discusses illustrative applications.</strong></p>

        <h6>I. INTRODUCTION</h6>
    </div>
    <p> Recently an empirical nonlinear analysis tool for complex,
        non-stationary time series has been pioneered by N. E. Huang
        et al. [1]. It is commonly referred to as <em>Empirical Mode Decomposition</em> 
         (EMD) and if combined with Hilbert spectral
        analysis it is called Hilbert- Huang Transform (HHT). It
        adaptively and locally decomposes any non-stationary time
        series in a sum of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) which
        represent zero-mean amplitude and frequency modulated
        components. The EMD represents a fully data-driven, un
       supervised signal decomposition and does not need any a
        priori defined basis system. EMD also satisfies the per
       fect reconstruction property, i.e. superimposing all extracted
        IMFs together with the residual slow trend reconstructs the
        original signal without information loss or distortion. The
        method is thus similar to the traditional Fourier or wavelet
        decompositions but the interpretation of IMFs is not similarly
        transparent [2]. It is still a challenging task to identify
        and/or combine extracted IMFs in a proper way so as to
        yield physically meaningful components. Also, if only partial
        reconstruction is intended, it is not based on any optimality
        criterion rather on a binary include or not include decision.
        The empirical nature of EMD offers the advantage over
        other empirical signal decomposition techniques like empir
       ical matrix factorization (EMF) of not being constrained by
        conditions which often only apply approximately. Especially
        with biomedical signals one often has only a rough idea about
        the underlying modes and mostly their number is unknown.</p>

                    <h6> II. EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION</h6>
                </div>
                <p> The EMD method was developed from the assumption
                    that any non-stationary and non-linear time series consists of
                    different simple intrinsic modes of oscillation. The essence
                    of the method is to empirically identify these intrinsic oscil
                   latory modes by their characteristic time scales in the data,
                    and then decompose the data accordingly. Through a process
                    called sifting, most of the riding waves, i.e. oscillations with
                    no zero crossing between extrema, can be eliminated. The
                    EMD algorithm thus considers signal oscillations at a very
                    local level and separates the data into locally non-overlapping
                    time scale components. It breaks down a signal x(t) into its
                    component IMFs obeying two properties:</p>
                    <!--lista de numeros -->
                    <ol>
                        <li>An IMF has only one extremum between two subse
                            quent zero crossings, i.e. the number of local minima
                             and maxima differs at most by one.</li>
                        <li> An IMF has a mean value of zero.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> Note that the second condition implies that an IMF is
                        stationary which simplifies its analysis. But an IMF may have
                        amplitude modulation and also changing frequency.</p>

                                 x(t) into IMFs xn(t) and a residuum r(t) such that the signal
                                 can be represented as</li>
